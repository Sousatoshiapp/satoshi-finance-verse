# Performance Optimization Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in the Satoshi Finance Verse application.

## Bundle Optimization

### Code Splitting Strategy
The application uses a multi-layered code splitting approach:

1. **Vendor Chunks**: Critical libraries separated by usage patterns
   - `vendor-react`: Core React libraries
   - `vendor-ui-core`: Essential UI components
   - `vendor-ui-forms`: Form-related UI components
   - `vendor-charts`: Chart and visualization libraries
   - `vendor-icons`: Icon libraries with tree-shaking

2. **Feature Chunks**: Application features split by domain
   - `chunk-quiz-core`: Core quiz functionality
   - `chunk-quiz-features`: Advanced quiz features
   - `chunk-social-core`: Basic social features
   - `chunk-admin-*`: Admin functionality split by area

### Icon Tree-Shaking
Icons are optimized using a two-tier system:
- **Core icons**: Bundled with main chunk (most frequently used)
- **Secondary icons**: Lazy-loaded on demand
- **Estimated savings**: ~200KB reduction in bundle size

## Context Optimization

### Split Context Architecture
Contexts are split by data domain to minimize re-renders:

- **PointsContext**: User points and BTZ balance
- **NotificationContext**: Real-time notifications
- **OnlineStatusContext**: User presence and online status
- **AuthContext**: Authentication state
- **I18nProvider**: Internationalization

### Performance Benefits
- Reduced re-render frequency
- Improved component isolation
- Better memory usage patterns

## Lazy Loading

### Component-Level Lazy Loading
- 76+ routes with React.lazy()
- Component-level splitting for heavy features
- Intelligent preloading based on user behavior

### Asset Lazy Loading
- Avatar images loaded on demand
- Dynamic imports for less common functionality
- Preloading of critical resources

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing with Vitest
- Fast test execution with Vite integration
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- Mocked dependencies for isolated testing

### Performance Testing
- Bundle size monitoring
- Render performance tracking
- Memory usage optimization

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Bundle Analysis
Use the following commands to analyze bundle performance:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### Performance Metrics
Key metrics to monitor:
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Time to Interactive (TTI)
- Bundle size by chunk

## Best Practices

### Development Guidelines
1. Use lazy loading for non-critical components
2. Implement proper memoization for expensive operations
3. Split contexts by data domain
4. Use tree-shaking for icon imports
5. Monitor bundle size regularly

### Code Organization
1. Group components by feature domain
2. Use barrel exports for clean imports
3. Implement proper TypeScript typing
4. Follow consistent naming conventions
